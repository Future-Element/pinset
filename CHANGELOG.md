# Changelog

## 1.5.0 - 2026-08-19

This release deliberately changes the project-resolution contract before broad adoption.

- Write schema 3 project/global configuration and lockfiles while retaining schema 1/2 readers.
- Keep requested selectors in configuration and exact resolved versions in lockfiles.
- Make projects strict by default, with explicit global inheritance, system fallback, and Git/filesystem boundary policy.
- Add `pinset current --explain`, `pinset which --explain`, and traditional-source diagnostics in `pinset doctor`.
- Add constraint-aware `pinset outdated`, lock-only `pinset update`, and explicit `pinset migrate`.
- Move provider-specific traditional-file declarations into Provider manifests; ordinary runtime routing still does not inspect those files.

Direct downgrade from schema 3 is not supported. Run `pinset migrate --dry-run` before migrating existing state and commit `pinset.toml` together with `pinset.lock`.
